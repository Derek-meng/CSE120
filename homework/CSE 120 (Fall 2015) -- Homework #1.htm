<!-- add points -->
<!-- 5pts/problem, except for multi-sub-part problems -->

</p><p> Each question is worth 5 points.  When a question asks you to
describe or explain, your answers can be relatively brief.  The [name]
tags give scholarly attribution to authors of other OS textbooks who
wrote the question.

</p><ol>

<p> <!-- 2.1 -->
</p><li> [Anderson 2.1] For each of the three mechanisms that supports
dual-mode operation — privileged instructions, memory
protection, and timer interrupts — explain what might go wrong
without that mechanism, assuming the system only had the other two.  (In
other words, if we just had memory protection and timer interrupts but
not privileged instructions, what could go wrong; if we just had
privileged instructions and timer interrupts, what could go wrong,
etc.)

<p>
</p></li><li> [Silberschatz] Some computer systems do not provide a privileged
mode of operation in hardware. Is it possible to construct a secure
operating system for these computers? Give arguments both that it is
and that it is not possible.  (By a secure operating system, we mean
that a user program is not able to corrupt the kernel, prevent it from
running, crash the system, violate memory protection, etc.)



<p><!-- 2.3 -->
<!--
<li> [Silberschatz] What are the differences between a trap and an
interrupt? What is the use of each function?
-->

</p><p><!-- 2.5 -->
</p></li><li> [Silberschatz] Which of the following instructions should be
privileged? (Also give a one-sentence explanation for why.)<p>
a) Set value of timer<br>
b) Read the clock<br>
c) Clear memory<br>
d) Turn off interrupts<br>
e) Switch from user to monitor (kernel) mode<br>

</p><p><!-- 2.8 -->
<!--
<li> [Silberschatz] Protecting the operating system is crucial
to ensuring that the computer system operates correctly. Provision of
this protection is the reason for dual mode opeartion, memory
protection, and the timer. To allow maximum flexibility, however, you
should also place minimal constraints on the use.<p>
The following is a list of instructions that are normally
protected. What is the minimal set of instructions from this list that must
be protected?
<p>a) Change to user mode
<br>b) Change to monitor mode
<br>c) Read from monitor memory
<br>d) Write into monitor memory
<br>e) Fetch an instruction from monitor memory
<br>f) Turn on timer interrupt
<br>g) Turn off timer interrupt
-->

</p></li><li> [Tanenbaum] For each of the following Unix system calls, give a
condition that causes it to
fail: <tt>open</tt>, <tt>read</tt>, <tt>fork</tt>,
<tt>exec</tt>, <tt>unlink</tt> (delete a file).  (Hint: We discussed
some in lecture, and you can also explore the error semantics of these
system calls using <tt>man</tt> on ieng6, e.g., <tt>man 2 fork</tt>.)

<p>
</p></li><li> List two challenges an operating system faces when passing
parameters between user and kernel mode.  Describe how an operating
system can overcome them.

<!--
<p>
<li> Chapter 2
<p>
2.11&nbsp; It is sometimes difficult to achieve a layered approach if
two components of the operating system are dependent on each other.
Identify a scenario in which it is unclear how to layer two system
components that require tight coupling of their functionalities.
-->


<!--
<p>
<li>Chapter 3: 9

<p>
3.9&nbsp; Why does Java provide the ability to call from a Java
program native methods that are written in, say, C or C++?
Provide an example where a native method is useful.
-->

<p>
</p></li><li>The Java runtime provides a set of standard system libraries for
use by programs.  To what extent are these libraries similar to the
system calls of an operating system, and to what extent are they
different?

<p>
</p></li><li>[Crowley] Suppose the hardware interval timer only counts
down to zero before signalling an interupt.  How could an OS
use the interval timer to keep track of the time of day?

<p> <!-- 2.13 -->
</p></li><li>[Anderson 2.13] Suppose you have to implement an operating system
on hardware that supports interrupts and exceptions but does not have
an explicit trap instruction.  Can you devise a satisfactory
substitute for traps using interrupts and/or exceptions?  If so,
explain how.  If not, explain why.  (In this context, the trap
instruction is the instruction used by a user-level process to invoke
a system call in the operating system, i.e., the trap instruction is
the system call instruction.)

<p>
</p></li><li>[Anderson 2.14] Suppose you have to implement an operating system
on hardware that supports exceptions and traps but does not have
interrupts.  Can you devise a satisfactory substitute for interrupts
using exceptions and/or traps?  If so, explain how.  If not, explain
why.

<!--
<p>
<li>[Tanenbaum] One reason GUIs were initially slow to be adopted was
the cost of the hardware needed to support them.  How much video RAM,
in bytes, is needed to support a 25 line X 80 row character monochrome
text screen?  How much for a 1024 X 768 24-bit color bitmap?  What was
the cost of this RAM at 1980 prices ($5/KB)?  How much is it now (say,
$0.25/MB)?
-->

<!--
<p>
<li>[Deitel] Using your Unix machine logged in with a normal user
account instead of root is an example of the principle of least
privilege.  Relate this principle to the concepts of user mode, kernel
mode, and privileged instructions.
